            <h3>“If your skin loves feeling refreshed, we think you should try this perfect all-natural cosmetics a try 🌿<br> it even has no fragrance which is actual perfection.”</h3>
            <p>An illustrated advertisement for a non-existent line of organic cosmetic line by Sephora. Meant to depict the cosmetics literally growing from plants and nature to show not just the cosmetic but to also visually represent one of its main features. All sizes are created to fit instagram limitations.</p>
