Before he knows it, he’s actually trying to be there for his daughter like his parents never were. <br>…That doesn’t mean he’s gonna give up rock though."</p>

                <p>Alina is an illustrator and comic artist born and raised in Richmond, BC. She’s been drawing for as long as she can remember. Just ask her parents, the walls will never be the same. Outside of illustrating, Alina likes to play the piano. No really- She was one of the kids that actually liked going to her piano lessons every Saturday. Make of that what you will.</p>
