            <h3><i>"It’s the early 1980s and hair metal was in vogue. Tony is just another young and out of control hair metal lead guitarist partying and sleeping his way through America. However, he’s forced to confront the consequences of his action when he became responsible for his infant daughter, born to one of the many groupies he had slept with while black-out drunk. And what may have started as an annoyance and obstacle soon turns into, what really is, his only family. Before he knows it, he’s actually trying to be there for his daughter like his parents never were. …That doesn’t mean he’s gonna give up rock though."</i></h3>
