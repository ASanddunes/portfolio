        <h1>Season in the Sun</h1>
        <h2>A Not-So-Real Summer Music Festival</h2>
        <h3><i>Season in the Sun is a summer music festival that means to bring relaxation through the music genre, City Pop. City Pop is a music genre that dominated 1980s Japan. It is characterized the use of synthesizers and a catchy beat. The genre of music is believed to have caught on among the youth of the 1980s as a form of escapism from their extremely stressful day to day lives as well as the national tragedies and crimes that shocked and struck fear and anxiety in the Japanese people in general. As such, Season in the Sun hopes to bring at least a few days of happiness and relaxation through escapism.</i></h3>
